## Wireframe ##
I designed my website layout using [balsamiq wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/). Main criteria was to create a basic layout structure which also would display where content would be placed and what shape it would take on different screen sizes, such as desktop, tablet & mobile.

You can view my wireframes [here](https://github.com/yetnetbehailu/Ivolunteer/blob/master/assets/wireframe/wireframe.pdf)
